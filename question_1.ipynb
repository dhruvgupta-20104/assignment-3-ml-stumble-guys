to roadhow now lorenzomy clerk hath some good comforts too for youay and ill give them him without a feethere do i give to you and jessicafrom the rich jew a special deed of giftafter his death of all he dies possessd offair ladies you drop manna in the wayof starved peopleit is almost morningand yet i am sure you are not satisfiedof these events at full let us go inand charge us there upon intergatoriesand we will answer all things faithfullylet it be so the first intergatorythat my nerissa shall be sworn on iswhether till the next night she had rather stayor go to bed now being two
